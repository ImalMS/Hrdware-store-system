Hardware management system is a web-based application that allows the manager to handle all activities through 
online. User friendly GUI and the ability to manage various orders make this system very flexibility and convenient. 
All the tasks are done by manager, so it is difficult to done manually on paper. This application approaches the 
reliability and flexibility to manage entire system as single online system. Hardware Management system provides 
online ordering, transporting, staff management, after service and necessary hardware management features. The 
system admin can be allowed to update system update on time. Customers can view, order items and get seasonal 
discounts. Admin has the power of either approving or disapproving the customer's booking request. The system is 
hence beneficial for both customers and managers to portably manage the hardware activities.
